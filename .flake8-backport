# Flake8 configuration

# rules added by this backport
# E302: expected 2 blank lines, found 1 - skipping since pasteurize may not leave blank lines in some cases
# E402: module level import not at top of file - skipping since pasteurize imports are at top of the file instead
# E501: line too long - skipping since future-fstrings will make lines longer
# F401: 'module.*' imported but unused - skipping since pasteurize imports are often unused
# F403: 'from module import *' used; unable to detect undefined names - skipping since pasteurize does this
